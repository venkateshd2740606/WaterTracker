## Third-Party SDKs

| SDK | Data types | Link |
|-----|------------|------|

| Firebase Crashlytics | Crash logs, device info | https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy |

## Consent Flow

- GDPR/CCPA consent screen on first launch (`ConsentScreen`)
- Analytics and ads disabled until user accepts applicable consents
- Consent state persisted in DataStore

## COPPA Considerations

- App rated Everyone; not targeted at children under 13
- No knowingly collected personal information from children
- Age-appropriate ads when ads are enabled
